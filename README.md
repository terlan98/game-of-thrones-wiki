### Disclaimer
I built this app when I was new to The Composable Architecture. If you find any implementation that deviates from the principles of the architecture or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open issues or pull requests. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me improve the app and my understanding of The Composable Architecture.
